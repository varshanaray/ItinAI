# ItinAI
ItinAI is a dynamic, user-centric platform designed to streamline the process of planning group travels. At its core, the app leverages the power of the GPT-3.5 Turbo AI model to craft a customizable travel itinerary, taking into account the diverse preferences and interests of each group member. Recognizing the complexity and often the difficulty of coordinating travel plans within groups, this app introduces a seamless, interactive approach to ensure every traveler's needs and wishes are addressed, thus enhancing the overall travel experience. Each traveler will be able to specify their exact preferences in the travel itinerary in a flexible format, and the itinerary will be generated based on every group memberâ€™s input. <br>
<br>
Upon the establishment of travel dates and the destination, the app enters its first phase of interaction, inviting all members of the travel group to input their travel preferences, interests, and any specific restrictions through an intuitive Interests Survey page. After the user input is collected, the app will prompt the GPT3.5-Turbo API to generate an itinerary based on the aggregated preferences of the group. Unlike traditional travel planning tools, this app empowers users to actively engage with the proposed itinerary. After the draft of the itinerary is generated, users are able to provide feedback on the initial plan, suggesting additions, deletions, or modifications to better align with the group's collective vision. <br>
<br>
The final itinerary, a product of collaborative filtering and AI optimization, is then displayed on the Itinerary page, accessible to all group members. The ability for continuous editing, post-generation, ensures that any last-minute changes or insights can still be incorporated, offering flexibility that mirrors the dynamic nature of travel itself.
