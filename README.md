**Deviations**<br>
There were no deviations in this phase. We were able to accomplish everything we said we would in the proposal. While there are still changes that need to be made to the UI, we spent time implementing a database and having the itinerary generation work exactly how we would like, completing the main functionality of our app. As a note, we have a demo account (email: tester@gmail.com & password: 123456) that can be used to see what the app looks like when a group has added multiple cities and generated an itinerary. Additionally, Note that when a city's itinerary is being accessed for the first time after the survey deadline has passed, it takes about 10 seconds for the app to generate and load the itinerary. The app is not frozen, and the loading screen is intended.
